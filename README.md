Theremin
==========
This was a quick project to introduce me to the WebAudio API. It mimics the functionality of a Theremin when a user clicks and drags their mouse around the browser window.

Try it out! https://shawntaylord.github.io/dope-theremin/

__NOTE__: Turn down volume before clicking! It can be very loud!
